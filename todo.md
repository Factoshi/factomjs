# Critical path

* Transform Admin block entries
* NoAck versions of add entry and add chain capacility to chose wait on commit/reveal both. Same for add*'s' ==> also expose just commit/reveal??
* WRITE TESTS
* Test all native api calls (factomdApi)

* newecaddress/newfctaddress => add to wallet or not ("generate-ec-address" "generate-factoid-address")

* RPC auth, SSL etc
* Cli version of wallet

# Non critical

* pendingentries, pendingtransactions
* receipt: what's a receipt?
* exportaddresses/listaddresses (what's the diff?)
