# Critical path
* NoAck versions of add entry and add chain capacility to chose wait on commit/reveal both. Same for add*'s'
* WRITE TESTS
* rename all Keymr to KeyMR?

* newecaddress/newfctaddress => add to wallet or not ("generate-ec-address" "generate-factoid-address")

* RPC auth, SSL etc
* Cli version of wallet


# Secondary API

# Non critical
## Inspired by Factom-cli

* abheight, dbheight, ecbheight, fbheight => heights
* pendingentries, pendingtransactions
* receipt: what's a receipt?
* exportaddresses/listaddresses (what's the diff?)

## Other
* Paginated retrieval
